## WWL Frontier Hack Event – Make the Case

**Suggested time:** 10 minutes  

Now that you’ve explored possible solutions, it’s time to select the one your team believes is the best fit - and justify your choice. The goal is to explain clearly *why* you chose it, *why others weren’t selected*, and ensure it’s the right level of complexity.  

You'll complete the following:  

- Evaluate your shortlisted solutions with Copilot  
- Select one solution to carry forward  
- Justify why it’s the best fit and why others were not chosen  

> **Note:** The provided sample prompts are just a starting point. Work with your team to adapt or create your own, and refine until Copilot delivers the results you need.

### Evaluate with Copilot  

Run your shortlisted solutions through Copilot to test the reasoning. Ask it to:  

- Justify why a given solution fits your problem  
- Suggest alternatives you may not have considered  
- Highlight risks, limitations, or gaps  

**Sample Prompt:**  

```text
 We are considering these AI solutions: [list options]. Which is the best fit for addressing [insert problem statement], and why? Suggest alternatives we may not have considered, and explain risks or limitations of each choice.  
```

### Select & Justify  

As a team, agree on **one solution** to carry forward. For your chosen option, capture:  

- Why this solution is the best fit  
- Why other options were not selected  
- How this solution avoids unnecessary complexity  

## Your Output  

**Section:** Chosen AI/Microsoft Solution & Why  

In the provided Workshop Template, fill in the **Chosen AI/Microsoft Solution & Why** section. Summarize the AI/Microsoft solution your team selected, explain why it’s the best fit, and note why other options were not chosen.
