## WWL AI Frontier Workshop – Break Down the Problem  

**Suggested time:** 10 minutes  

Next, your team will take the problem or opportunity you defined earlier and break it down into smaller parts. The goal is to clarify the statement, decompose it into smaller issues, map pain points, and use Copilot to uncover contributing factors or impacts.  

You'll complete the following activities:  

- Break the problem into smaller issues or components  
- Map pain points and inefficiencies  
- Use Copilot to explore causes, impacts, and related discussions  

> **Note:** The provided sample prompts are just a starting point. Work with your team to adapt or create your own, and refine until Copilot delivers the results you need.

### Break the Problem Into Smaller Issues  

Work together to decompose your problem statement into sub-issues or smaller components.  

- What parts make this problem challenging?  
- Are there multiple steps or areas of the workflow that contribute?  
- Which sub-issues could be addressed independently (including quick wins)?  

This breakdown will help spark ideas for possible AI solutions in the next section.

### Map Pain Points & Explore with Copilot  

Discuss and document where the current process breaks down. Focus on:  

- Manual tasks  
- Bottlenecks  
- Data gaps  
- Sources of frustration  

> **Optional:** You can also think about the impact of these issues — such as lost time, extra cost, or reduced quality. This can help Copilot (and your team) better frame the problem.

Once you’ve listed these pain points, use **Copilot Chat (or Researcher)** to expand your understanding:  

- What are the likely root causes?  
- What impacts does this issue have on people, workflows, or outcomes?  
- Have any related suggestions or discussions surfaced in the past six months?  

    **Sample Prompt:**

    ```text
    Explore the issue of [Insert Problem Statement Here]. Look for factors that contribute to this problem, its impact on people or workflows, and any related discussions or suggestions raised in the past six months. Summarize your findings in a simple table with three columns: Insight Type (Cause, Impact, or Suggestion), Description, and Source.
     ```

    > **Tip:** Use **Work Mode** to draw from your organizational data (Teams, Outlook, OneDrive), or try **Researcher** to dive deeper into public and internal resources.  

## Your Output  

**Section:** Pain Points & Inefficiencies  

In the provided Workshop Template, fill in the **Pain Points & Inefficiencies** section. Summarize the main breakdowns your team identified, along with any root causes, impacts, or suggestions surfaced with Copilot.
