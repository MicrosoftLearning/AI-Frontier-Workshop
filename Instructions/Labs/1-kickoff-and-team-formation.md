## WWL AI Frontier Workshop – Kickoff & Team Formation

**Suggested time:** 10 minutes  

You'll start the workshop by meeting your team members and Table Coach. This is your chance to build rapport and set the tone for how you’ll collaborate during the rest of the session. By the end, your team should feel comfortable working together and ready to dive into problem-solving.  

You'll complete the following:  

- Introduce yourself to your team members and identify your Table Coach  
- Come up with a team name  
- Create a Team Worksheet  
- *(Optional)* Assign team roles to help structure your collaboration  

### Team Introductions & Identify Your Table Coach  

Take 5 minutes to meet your fellow team members and confirm who your Table Coach is.

Share:  

- **Your Name**  
- **Your Role**  
- **One quick thought about AI** (e.g., what excites you most or what challenges you see ahead)  

### Create a Team Name  

Work together to come up with a team name that represents your group. Keep it fun, creative, or tied to your focus area.  

### Create a Team Worksheet  

Throughout the workshop, you'll be referencing notes from prior exercises. To help keep your thoughts and ideas organized, create a shared Team Worksheet. This can be a Word document or a Loop workspace.  

Have one person from your team complete either of the following options:  

**In Word:**  

- Open a browser and navigate to [word.new](https://word.new)  
- Select **Share** in the top right corner and then **Copy Link**  
- Share the link with your team members  

**In Loop (Pages):**  

- Open a browser and navigate to [loop.cloud.microsoft](https://loop.cloud.microsoft/)  
- Select **+ New workspace** from the top left-hand corner  
- Name your workspace (e.g., "AI Frontier Workshop")  
- Add your participants to the workspace where it says **Share your space**  
- Select **Create**  

### *(Optional)* Assign Team Roles  

If helpful, assign roles to structure your collaboration. Multiple people can share the same role, or you may skip this step if your team prefers to stay fluid.  

**Suggested roles:**  

- **Facilitator:** Keeps the team focused and on time.  
- **Problem Compiler:** Collects and organizes challenges into a list.  
- **Prompt Runner:** Operates Copilot on behalf of the team.  
- **Note Taker:** Captures key ideas and drafts the problem statement.  
- **Presenter:** Shares the team’s work during submissions.  
- **AI Builder (optional):** Experiments with testing or prototyping later.  

## Workshop Output  

**Section:** Team Name  

In your team Word document or worksheet, create a section titled *“Team Name.”* Record the name your team agreed on — this will be used to identify your group throughout the workshop.
