## WWL Frontier Hack Event – Kickoff & Team Formation

**Suggested time:** 10 minutes  

You'll start the workshop by meeting your team members and Table Coach. This is your chance to build rapport and set the tone for how you’ll collaborate during the rest of the session. By the end, your team should feel comfortable working together and ready to dive into problem-solving.  

You'll complete the following:  

- Introduce yourself to your team members and identify your Table Coach  
- Come up with a team name  
- Create a Team Worksheet  
- Set your team’s collaboration style  

### Team Introductions & Identify Your Table Coach  

Take 5 minutes to meet your fellow team members and confirm who your Table Coach is.

Share:  

- **Your Name**  
- **Your Role**  
- **One quick thought about AI** (e.g., what excites you most or what challenges you see ahead)  

### Create a Team Name  

Work together to come up with a team name that represents your group. Keep it fun, creative, or tied to your focus area.  

### Download your Teams Hack Event Template

Throughout the workshop, you’ll be capturing notes and outputs from each step.  

To keep your team’s ideas organized - and to ensure your final submission is complete - use the provided **Hack Event Template**.  

Have one person from your team:  

- Open the <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/Frontier-Hack-Event/raw/refs/heads/master/Resourcefiles/HackEventTemplate.docx" target="_blank">Hackathon Event Templatee</a>.
- Download the file and save it to your desktop.  
- Open the file and **enable editing** if prompted.  

Optionally, to make collaboration easier:  

- In the top left corner, turn on **AutoSave**.  
- If prompted *“How do I turn on AutoSave”*, select your Microsoft OneDrive account.  
- In the top right corner, select **Share**.  
- Copy the link and send it to your teammates.  

### Collaboration  

Lean on your Table Coach to help guide how your team works together. Some teams may want to assign roles (like **Prompt Runner**, **Note Taker**, or **Timekeeper**) while others may prefer to stay fluid and share responsibilities.

Your coach will check in to ensure everyone is contributing and comfortable with the team’s approach - but feel free to decide together what works best for your group

## Your Output  

**Section:** Team Name & Table Number  

In the provided Hack Event Template, fill in the fields for Team Name and Table Number.
