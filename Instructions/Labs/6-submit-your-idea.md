## WWL AI Frontier Workshop – Submit Your Idea

**Suggested time:** 10 minutes  

In this final step, your team will bring everything together and submit your idea for judging.

You'll complete the following:  

- Summarize Your Solution and Key Insights  
- *(Optional)* Create a logo or image for your solution  
- Submit your idea for judging  

> **Note:** The provided sample prompts are just a starting point. Work with your team to adapt or create your own, and refine until Copilot delivers the results you need.

### Summarize Your Solution and Key Insights  

In the provided Workshop Template, fill in the **Short Summary & Key Insights** section. Summarize the solution your team selected and make note of any key insights you’d like documented. This is your team’s **final required output**.  

> **Tip:** Use Copilot in Word to help generate a polished summary. Start with a brief overview of the solution, then highlight any unique aspects or important considerations.  

### *(Optional)* Create an Image  

If time allows, use **Creator** to design a simple image or logo for your solution.  

**Steps:**  

- Navigate to <a href="https://m365.cloud.microsoft/create" target="_blank">m365.cloud.microsoft/create</a>  
- Select **Create an image**  
- Enter your prompt where it says *“Describe your image”*  

    **Sample Prompt:**

    ```text
    Create a simple and modern logo for a solution named [Solution Name] that targets [target audience/industry]. The logo should convey [desired qualities, e.g., innovation, reliability].
    ```

    > Replace the bracketed text with your team’s choices.  

- Choose a style, brand color, and size  
- Select **Create**  

### Submit Your Idea  

Once your Workshop Template is complete, submit your team’s idea for judging.
