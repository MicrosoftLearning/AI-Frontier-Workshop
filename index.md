# WWL AI Frontier Workshop  

Welcome to the **WWL AI Frontier Workshop**!  

This workshop is about exploring how AI and Copilot can help us tackle real challenges at work.  
You’ll collaborate with your team to define a problem, brainstorm solutions, and craft a pitch — with the help of your Table Coach and Copilot.  

> **Goal:** Accelerate alignment on the *Frontier Firm* concept and generate **AI-driven problem statements and solution ideas**.
